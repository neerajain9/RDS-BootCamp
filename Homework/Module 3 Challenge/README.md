# Election Audit

## Overview of the Election Audit
Election Commission has the election audit results that Seth and Tom submitted. The audit results consisted of the total votes casted, voted count for each candidate along with it percentage of the total votes casted, and the winning candidate with his/her vote count anlongwith the percentage vote he/she received.

Now, the Elcetion Commission needs to further analyze the results by the County. Their focus is to understand how votes were being casted in each county, the percentage of votes counted (of the total votes), the vote count for each county, and finally the county that had the largest turnout. 


## Election Audit Results
- Total votes casted: **369,711**
- **Votes by County:**
  - In Jefferson county, the total votes casted were 38,855 which is 10.5% of the total votes.
  - In **Denver county**, the total votes casted were **306,055** which is **82.8%** of the total votes.
  - In Arapahoe county, the total votes casted were 24,801 which is 6.7% of the total votes.
- **Denver count had the largest turnout** i.e. 306,055 votes out of 369, 711 votes in total.
- **Votes by Candidates:**
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes in all i.e. 23.0% of the total votes.
  - **Diana DeGette lead the election poll with 272,892 votes** i.e. 73.8% of the total votes.
  - Raymon Anthony Doane could secure only 11,606 votes in all i.e. 3.1% votes in all.

**NOTES:** This was a great election to run the audit on. It seems **Dever had been a popular county** and **Diana DeGette** had a **remarkable win** in the elections with **record breaking 272,892 votes**.

Following is a snippet of our analysis that we ran electronically.

## Election Audit Summary
Now, that we have run this amazing analysis/audit, the Election Commission now do not need to go through the painful manual analysis down the road.

The same script can be used to run the audit simply by replacing the "election_results.csv" file and executing this python script.

Like any audit/analysis there's always room to infer various outher aspects. We think following changes/additions to the exisiting audit could bring certain other interesting facts that are hidden behind the data. We are presenting only couple of suggestions, however, we are sure there could be other avanue that may be explored.
1. It would be interesting to know if any specific candidate was more popular in a specific county. The popularity reasons could further be drilled down based on voter's demographics, candidate's residency in the county, candidate's work/efforts in making that county a better place to live, etc.
1. Also, the ratio of county votes against each other could be a significant pointer to establish an understanding the relationship with each county and the contesting candidate in that county. In other words, is there a corrlation that a cnadidaet is more popular in on county than other?

## Conclusions:
Like in any analysis projects one needs to be more thoughtful to ask the right questions. And, how these questions are helpful in addressing certain concerns and/or improvements in the process overall. We are glad we could lend a hand and hope to have much deeper and meaningful analysis impacting the decision making process.
