# Module 6 Challenge
## Overview
PlanMyTrip app worked fine with our help in the previous exercise. There are some recommended changes to improve user experience. The customer recommendation is to add the weather description to the weather data that our app is already retreiving.

Also, we would need to include and input statement to take customer's preference and search potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.

In addition, we would then pick four cities out of these travel destinations and create a travel itinerary.

Finally, we would equip our users with a travel route between these four cities (plus amarker map would be perfect for easy location spotting).

## Weather Database
This is a snippet of our Weatehr DB as we extracted it using random latitudes and longitues.

## Vaccation Map
Refer the [vaccation map](https://github.com/neerajain9/RDS-BootCamp/blob/master/Homework/Module%206%20Challenge/Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation_map.png) we prepared based on this Weather DB. You might want to pick couple of spots before summer goes away.

## Vaccation Itinerary
My partner and I decided to go to [Argentina](https://github.com/neerajain9/RDS-BootCamp/blob/master/Homework/Module%206%20Challenge/Vacation_Itinerary/WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png). We are flying to Buenos Aires and will then hop onto our car to start our trip from a city called "Mercedes". We will then go to Veinticinco De Mayo. Our next stop will be Necochea city along the coast lines. And out final city to visit before we return back to Mercedes would be Mar Del Plata.

We wish, we had more time to [explore some country](https://github.com/neerajain9/RDS-BootCamp/blob/master/Homework/Module%206%20Challenge/Vacation_Itinerary/WeatherPy_travel_map.png) side. But that's all we have on our agenda for this quick trip.
